You are also responsible for informing the members in your discord server about these terms. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using or adding any version of YandexMusic to your server.

We grant you the permission to use this available data for your own needs, but strictly disallow any commercial use.

                <p>
                    YandexMusic is provided as-is. There are no guarantees that it will be available in the future, and its purpose or availability may be changed at any time.
                    User related data including backups may be deleted at any time.
                    User related data including backups is non-transferable between discord accounts.
                    Any premium or paid features are not guaranteed. They may change or be revoked at any time.
                    Access to all or specific features of YandexMusic may be revoked, for all or a specific user, at any time.

                <h2>Refund Policy</h2>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Refunds for payments may be issued when the user requests it and one of the following requirements is met:
                    it's the first payment and the user requests a refund on the same day
                    it's a monthly recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a three day period
                    it's an annual recurring payment and the user requests a refund in a seven day period
                    A major premium or paid feature was removed and the user bought the tier specifically because of that feature
                    We still require a comprehensible explanation of the situation and never guarantee a refund. Partial refunds might be issued for annual payments under special circumstances. Refunds are never issued if you have broken our Terms of Service and therefore lost access to certain or all features.
